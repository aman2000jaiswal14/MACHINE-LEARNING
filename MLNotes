class -> pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
         'package'         'Class'

small letter = package or folder
Camel case = Class
official term for column is features(training features)
and row is called training instance
ML has two data
1->Numeric data(int ,float)

2->Object data(text)


understanding the data with visualization
#A Univariate Plots
 In this section we will look at three techniques
 that you can use to understand each attribute of your dataset independently,

1 ) Univariate Histogram Plot. --- gives frequency
2 ) Univariate Density Plots.  --- gives the pattern of frequency
3 ) Univariate Box and Whisker Plots. --- Gives the central tendency of outliers

HYPOTHESIS INSTANCE

-  BEST FIT HYPOTHESIS INSTANCE IS THE LINE WHOSE ACCURACY IS MAXIMUM i.e. IT LIES CLOSELY WITH THE DATA POINTS
- Hypothesis Instance Parameter is m and c
- GROUP OF ALL HYPOTHSIS INSTANCE IS HYPOTHESIS SPACE
- THE GENERAL FORMULA IS KNOWN AS HYPOTHESIS SPACE AND BY PUTTING PARTICULAR VALUE OR PARAMETER IS KNOWN AS HYPOTHESIS INSTANCE

INTERNAL VARIABLE is recoginize by -
underscore is either in the first variable name or last of variable name
example = __version__

to train data we fit the label data.

---metadata of column is columns
---metadata of row is index


#B) MULTIVARIATE PLOTS

1)- correlation matrix plot    ---- it help in feature selection (or feature elemenation)

2)-scatter matrix plot


# Prepare data for machine learning
4 ways to prepare the data for Machine learning

1) Rescale data. (custom range)
2) Standardize data
3) Normalize data
4) Binarize data

Steps of data Transforms

1) Load the data set from a URL
2) Split the dataset into the input and output variables for machine learning
3) Apply a pre-processing transformation technique to transform the input variables.
4) Summarize the data to show the changes

(M)

Y is  expected output or target output
we pass array of training instance in fit.

Standardize the data means average of data is zero
– convert the data into gausian distribution.
– Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance.

normalized data is same as rescale data but we need not to enter the scale it automatically scale from 0 to 1

binarize data means convert continuous data to  catogiral(discreate)data
